			<h2>Unit 2</h2>
				<p id="overview"> <img src="http://dailydropcap.com/images/I-12-cap.png" title="Daily Drop Cap by Jessica Hische" align="left" alt="I"/>n this section, I am going to write a brief summary about the things I learned in this unit. I will use the paragraph tag to separate these two paragraph summaries.<p>
				<p>I am also going to make an unordered OR ordered  list right here under the paragraphs, listing the things I found particularly informaative in this unit.</p>
					<p>Throughout this unit I have learned this basics of html. I learned to how to create a root folder, start an html page, and how to indent coding. Some of the coding I had already known, but I learned how to make it better. In addition, it's important to communicate with others about their coding to see how you could improve.  </p>
					<ul>
						<li>Creating captions for a video.</li>
						<li>Key details to remember when uploading a video.</li>
						<li>How to link different items in the root folder.</li>
					</ul>
			<h2>Unit 3</h2>
				<p class="temp">In Unit 3 I have learned many things about CSS and discovered how fun it was. One of the many interesting things that I have found out about it was about the font-family. I had no idea that you had to choose 4 fonts incase the first or second one isn't compatible with the computer. I found it very fun to design the website to my liking. CSS offers a lot of options and I'm excited to explore them as we progress more.</p>
			<h2>Unit 4</h2>
				<p> <div id="buttons">
				<a href="graphics.html">

					</div>
					In Unit 4 the most difficult challenge I have come across is doing the web banner. Putting in the code for it wasn't difficult, but deciding what it should look like was hard for me. Even though I am in graphic design, I've only learned how to make graphics for other companies rather then to make a graphic that represents me. The easiest thing that I learned was adding images and adjusting the size. I also learned that you have to set the size in the coding as well. I finally understand why some pages take longer to load then others. 
				</p>
			<h2>Unit 5</h2>
				<p class="temp"> Unit 5 was more of learning each part of the coding and how they all affect eachother. The most difficult part for me was checking the case sensitivy of each line of code. Also with all the semicolons and making sure that the tags were closed. Many of of these difficulties is what I've dealt with in the past, except that Javascript isn't forgiving. </p>
			<h2>Unit 6</h2>
				<p> Unit 6 was a more indepth look to Javascript. At first we would watch videos of how certain functions work and it helped me a lot when we had to work on making a form for our own page. The main difficulty that I found when working in this is that Javascript is case sensitive. Since I am use to coding with more forgiving languages like html, I struggled a but when creating the code. At the end of the unit we had other people check out our website and it wasn't until then that I realized how confusing some of it might be. Overall the most important thing that I learned is not to assume things will coding. Like to not assume that the browser knows what code you're trying to put or to not assume that you're client would know where all the shortcuts are at.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Case sensitivity</li>
					<li>Learn how to evaluate websites</li>
					<li>Learned how create a survey that reflects off of your website.</li>
				</ul>
